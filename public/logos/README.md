## Keeping standard logos

For now, we have to save logos on this directory

If you're uploading an image for partners make sure that it complies with the following:
- Black logo
- in .png format
- name should be in lowecase `gelato.png`
- name should only be one word, for example `gelato_network.png` will raise errors in the Testimonial component
